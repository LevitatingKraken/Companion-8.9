# PF2e-Animal-Companions

Once enabled in a world it will add 7 compendiums:
- The first contains all the animal companions released as of March 2021 statted up as ancestries to enable Foundry automation, as well as an Animal Companion class.  Just drag the correct ones to the PC sheet you are using for your Animal Companion.
- The second contains feats to automate the Mature, Nimble, Indomitable, Savage, and Specialized bonuses.  Drag these feats to the animal companion sheet when your PC takes the associated feat.
- The third compendium contains actions for the Advanced Maneuvers. These are automatically added to the sheet when your companion gains access.
- The fourth contains support actions for your animal companion.  These are automatically added.
- The fifth contains a class, ancestry, and features for Inventor Construct Companions.
- The last contains the ancestry features linked to by the Ancestries.  You should not need to drag these to the sheet, they should automatically be added by the ancestries.

# Known Issues
- Barding proficiency is not automated.  Barding is not currently in the system as an armor type, adding barding proficiency manually or through Active effects adds it as a weapon group instead of an armor type.  For barding use one of the armor proficiency groups and make custom armor items.
